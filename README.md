# Neighborhood
This is an application that allows users to sign up, choose neighborhoods, post updates on their neighborhoods, view updates within their neighborhoods, search for businesses within their neighborhoods, see Police and Hospital contacts, and update their profile details such as change of location when they move out.

### Developed By
Samuel Oluoch Mukoya

### Description
In the app, users have to sign up for accounts before starting to post updates. After the users register, they can then login and start posting neighborhood updates through their profiles. They can also view and search for businesses that are within their neighborhoods. Additionally, only users who are within a given neighborhood can view post updates, businesses, and emergency contact details that apply to that particular neighborhood. Users can also update their profile details, including their neighborhoods and start viewing details of the new neighborhoods to which they will have moved. Furthermore, users are able to see the number of people living in their neighborhoods.
